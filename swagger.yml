  title: 🔍 Query Gateway
  version: 3.0.1
  description: |
    ## 📋 Overview

    The Query Gateway is a dynamic SQL execution engine that securely connects to multiple database types (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle) and executes pre-configured queries stored in the system. It supports runtime decryption of database credentials, dynamic query construction with variable and replacement maps, and unified result aggregation across sources.

    This service enables a centralized way to securely and flexibly query external databases without hardcoding SQL, database credentials, or connection logic in client applications.

    ### 🎯 Objectives

    - Dynamically execute stored SQL queries across multiple databases
    - Support MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle with dialect-specific handling
    - Securely decrypt and use database credentials at runtime (AES-256-CBC)
    - Allow dynamic parameterization via variable_map and replacement_map
    - Gracefully handle failures per query while maintaining partial success responses
    - Return all query results in a unified, structured response object
    - Enable easy extension and onboarding of new data sources through configuration
